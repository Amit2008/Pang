I am pleased to present my work on the project, showcasing my coding skills and highlighting the robust architecture that underpins its development. Throughout the project, I focused on maintaining a consistent and well-structured codebase while prioritizing core gameplay mechanics and the implementation of a solid MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

The primary goal of the project was to create an engaging game with a strong emphasis on code quality and architectural design. I successfully achieved this by adhering to the MVC pattern, which allowed for a clear separation of concerns and facilitated modular development. The Model component handled the game logic, data structures, and level difficulties, ensuring that the game's core functionality was robust and easily expandable. The View component, represented by various scripts and UI elements, provided a clean and intuitive user interface, enabling players to interact with the game seamlessly. Finally, the Controller component, comprised of input handling and event-driven systems, facilitated smooth communication between the Model and View, ensuring a cohesive and responsive gameplay experience.

While developing the project, I had the opportunity to implement additional features for extra credit points. Although I did not pursue certain visual and auditory enhancements, such as custom visuals, shaders, soundtracks, and sound effects, I made a conscious decision to prioritize the core gameplay mechanics and architectural integrity. By focusing on these aspects, I ensured that the project's foundation was solid and capable of accommodating future enhancements effortlessly.

Moreover, I successfully implemented three extra levels with different difficulties, showcasing my ability to extend the game's functionality in a scalable and maintainable manner. This demonstrates my commitment to delivering a comprehensive and well-rounded product that is both engaging and adaptable to various player skill levels.

It is important to note that the decision not to pursue certain extra credit points was not due to a lack of capability or dedication. Instead, it was a strategic choice made to ensure that the project's core gameplay mechanics and architecture were of the highest quality. Adding custom art, visual effects, multiplayer functionality, or leaderboards would have been feasible, given the well-structured codebase, and could be considered for future iterations or enhancements.

In conclusion, my work on this project exemplifies my strong coding skills, architectural expertise, and dedication to delivering a high-quality product. The consistent application of the MVC pattern, coupled with the implementation of additional levels with varying difficulties, demonstrates my ability to create a scalable and engaging game experience. While certain extra credit points were not pursued, the project's solid foundation makes it well-suited for future enhancements and additions, ensuring its adaptability and longevity. I am confident that my work will be respected by the team, and I look forward to further contributing to the success of future projects.
